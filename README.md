# HiCoNet Server
This is the web server for HiCoNet. 
A separate project of hiconet-explorer focuses on web based data exploring and interaction.

This extends our earlier `Cruncher` application (led by JR). Current major changes:
* Adding Boostrap CSS to Django;
* New UI for visualizing results.

Steve P has detailed documentation under his repo. E.g. deployment on a VM:
