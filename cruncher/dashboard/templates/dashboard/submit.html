                                <p> HiCoNet is designed for integration of multiple data types collected from a common group of subjects.
                                    Each data type is regarded as a "society".
                                    HiCoNet detects "communities" within "society", then tests the association between communities across data types. 
                                    This "hierarchical community network" thus provides a reasonable model of the organizational structure of measured biology.

                                    We need for each data type in tab-dilimited files a DataMatrix, 
                                    and sometimes optionally FeatureAnnotation and ObservationAnnotation.

                                DataMatrix: a data matrix of [continuous] values that represent a biological state or concentration, of the same data type.
                                E.g. transcriptomics (array intensity or transcript counts), metabolomics (peak intensity/area) or microbial OTU counts.
                                This can include different time points or treatments. This is the unit community detection is based on.

                            ObservationAnnotation: an observation is an experimental measurement of a biological sample. 
                                A sample may have measurement replicates. Description of biological samples should be in ObservationAnnotation, which can support inferring the study design (e.g. treatment, time points). For ImmPort data, the MySQL table `biosample` can serve as ObservationAnnotation. Time points and treatment are key annotation variables in many studies. 

                            FeatureAnnotation: meta data on features. 
                                This can be as simple as gene annotation, which can even be optional. But a feature may carry a defition of multiple parameters. E.g. a metabolite feaure may have m/z, retention time and collision cross section, and these parameters may be used for certain algorithms.
